Title: MRPT got accepted into GSoC 2018!
Date: 2018-02-15 09:00

We're delighted to announce that MRPT [has been selected](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6305642571104256/)
to participate into Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018!

As you probably know, this program aims at consolidating communities
around open-source projects by allowing skilled students to devote ~3
months to a project of his/her interest. In turn, students receive an
stipend that depends on the country of residence but should be roughly
equivalent to 6000 $ (USD).

Feel free of spreading the word among friends who may be interested! ;-)

Important points:

* Being selected is a very competitive process.
* It's required to ensure that the interested student will have spare
time to devote to the project (June-July-August), i.e. this cannot be
simultaneous to another full-time job. Having to take exams may be
acceptable if a realistic working plan is approved by mentors.
* Although a decent C++ knowledge is required for all our projects,
for the first time in MRPT history in GSoC we also offer projects for
JavaScript experts! ;-)

Make sure of studying the [official timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and our list of
proposed ideas, list of mentors, etc. [here](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/wiki/Ideas-page-for-MRPT-Google-Summer-of-Code-2018).

Interested candidates are encouraged to open a thread in [our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mrpt-users)
to introduce themselves and discuss about their proposed
project or ideas.
