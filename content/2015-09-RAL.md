#Category: Review

I have the pleasure of joining the team of the new journal [IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters](http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (RA-L)
as Associate Editor.

## Scope

The scope of this journal is to publish peer-reviewed articles that provide a timely and concise account of innovative research ideas and application results, reporting significant theoretical findings and application case studies in areas of robotics and automation.

## RA-Letters and Flagship Conferences (ICRA, CASE, and IROS)

A unique feature of RA-L is the opportunity for authors to publish a paper in a peer-reviewed journal and present the same paper at the flagship conferences of RAS: the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) and the IEEE Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE). From 2017, RAL also offers an option for the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).
